% Does the code run without error? If any error occurs, can you suggest a potential fix?
% The code runs without any error when tested on Matlab. 
% How understandable is the output of the code? Point out any parts you do not understand.
% I am not fully understanding the code because there is no description in the .m file but based on the output of 
the code it looks like there is a measure with the increase of weight and velocity in regards to a pulley action 
taking place. Other than that, I believe I could figure out what the output of the code is. 
% How readable is the code itself? Say where formatting or commenting would make the code more readable
% The formatting and code itself is readable and is well organized. 
% How clearly do the code comments describe the problem it is trying to solve? Identify places that would benefit from a clearer comment.
% Very good parameters are labeled and organized. Improved  
% How clearly do the variable names relate to the concepts they concretize? Point out any variables you don't recognize, and/or suggest better names.
% All variable names seem to have very good labeling and understanding as to what they are and especially since they 
are common variables like m for mass, v for velocity, and g for gravity. 
% How well does the range of variables capture the problem described? Identify extraneous regions that could be left out or important 
regions that should be included.
% Important regions that should be included should be a good description of what the code is actually doing in regards to a 
pulley being involved. Something that was left out was the computed parameters if there is any in sense of potentially maximum
weight or gravity being 9.8 since gravity is gravity. 
% How clearly do the visualizations show the solutions to the problem? Say if there is extraneous whitespace or the co-domain 
or domain of the data should be changed or any other ways the visualizations could be more effective
% The visualizations are pretty clear in regards to showing the solution to the problem.
