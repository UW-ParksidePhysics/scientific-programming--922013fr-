% Simulation parameters
%	These are values particular to the simulation 
%	that do not change later in the script
% Intial velocity (v0) = 2 m/s
% Intial height   (h0) = 5 m
% Gravity          (g) = 9.81 m/s
% Height of pulley (H) = 10 m 
% Radius of pulley (R) = 1 m
% Length of rope   (L) = 15 m 
% Masses          (m1) = 2 kg
%                 (m2) = 5 kg
% Computed parameters (from simulation parameters)
%	These are values that do not change later in the script
%	and are calculated from formulas using the simulation parameters

% Does the code run without error? If any error occurs, can you suggest a potential fix?
% The code runs without any error when tested on Matlab. 
% How understandable is the output of the code? Point out any parts you do not understand.
% I am not fully understanding the code because there is no description in the .m file but based on the output of 
the code it looks like there is a measure with the increase of weight and velocity in regards to a pulley action 
taking place. Other than that, I believe I could figure out what the output of the code is. 
% How readable is the code itself? Say where formatting or commenting would make the code more readable
% I suggest potentially organizing and separating the separate variable like m1 and m2 to be able to read the
code as it goes vs it all just going down one line after another. 
% How clearly do the code comments describe the problem it is trying to solve? Identify places that would benefit from a clearer comment.
% Very good parameters are labeled and organized but do not see any code comments that go more specific as to what the code is trying to solve. 
% How clearly do the variable names relate to the concepts they concretize? Point out any variables you don't recognize, and/or suggest better names.
% All variable names seem to have very good labeling and understanding as to what they are and especially since they 
are common variables like m for mass, v for velocity, and g for gravity. 
% How well does the range of variables capture the problem described? Identify extraneous regions that could be left out or important 
regions that should be included.
% Important regions that should be included should be a good description of what the code is actually doing in regards to a 
pulley being involved. Something that was left out was the computed parameters if there is any in sense of potentially maximum
weight or gravity being 9.8 since gravity is gravity. 
% How clearly do the visualizations show the solutions to the problem? Say if there is extraneous whitespace or the co-domain 
or domain of the data should be changed or any other ways the visualizations could be more effective
% The visualizations are pretty clear in regards to showing the solution to the problem but there is no comment describing the 
code which is making it a bit unknown. Yet the output of the code in regards to graphing is pretty clear.
